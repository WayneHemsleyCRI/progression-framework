## Junior UX Researcher



### Knowledge

You understand the theory and fundamentals of most qualitative and quantitative research methods. What's more important, you know their limitations and when to apply them. You know the principles of user testing, and know the kind of results you can expect based on the interactions offered by the fidelity of the prototype that's used.  

### Ownership

You collaborate on  research projects from collection of feedback, delivering sensible talking points from the feedback and ensuring this is considered on the project through to delivery. The insight you generate is immediately useful and provides clear direction for the teams you work with. You can recognise when it's worth running research on something and when it isn't.  

### Collaboration

You avoid "big reveal" research within the squads you work with by involving other disciplines at every step. Although you share insight quickly to keep your team informed, you're mindful of the limitations of the research you've run, from the biases and the assumptions that were made. You have a positive impact in your squad by reducing the uncertainty around decision-making.

## UX Researcher



### Knowledge

You understand the theory and fundamentals of multiple research methods (both qualitative and quantitative). What's more important, you know their limitations and can clearly articulate how to apply them appropriately. You've also learned to observe interactions in a natural way so you can figure out what our users need even when they're not around a screen. Your communication and organisational skills are good so your research insights can be extended and consumed by others with ease. You understand basic design principles and how specific patterns influence behaviour. 

### Ownership

You run smaller research projects independently and confidently, from planning to delivery. You also have a mature measure to know how much research something deserves, based on our company goals and constraints. You proactively find ways of improving research operations and happily take ownership of them. 

### Collaboration

You ensure that research doesn't happen in a bubble by sharing and working with other teams across the company. You're good at bridging the gap between data sources of insight so we can understand the people, their motivations and the context behind behaviours with the product.

## Senior UX Researcher



### Knowledge

You've mastered the range of qualitative and quantitative research methods and when to apply them. The recommendations that come out of your research are highly impactful, not just because of the way you communicate and organise them, but also because you know how to adapt them to different people in the company depending on their priorities. You know what industry best practice design guidelines look like and can recommend patterns depending on the behaviour we want to drive.  

### Ownership

You understand which disciplines to pull in at what moment to progress projects so we can learn quickly in a way that's robust and as unbiased as possible â€“ which doesn't necessarily involve user research. You work closely with data to identify company goals whilst solving the right customer problems in the right way.  

### Collaboration

You regularly share insight at Bright, from projects you've run and papers or articles you've read. You link insight at Bright to events happening in the industry and beyond, so you can help your colleagues understand how what we do day-to-day relates to the bigger picture of solving customer problems.
